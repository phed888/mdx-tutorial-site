Conversations with the Virtual Assistant (VA) differ from human-to-human conversations in that the VA can only respond in predetermined ways. Its important to understand what the VA will need to complete the skill and to ensure that it can respond effectively to unexpected responses and either continue to move forward or to transfer the customer to an agent.

  For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be looking at a simple skill: asking for the check-in time of a hotel booking.

- there is an existing skill to verify a customer so our customer will be verified
- we will know from the intent that the question is about a hotel booking
- we might need to ask which hotel booking the customer means
- we will know whether or not it is a multi-room booking
- we will know whether or not the hotel has provided us with check-in times
- we will know whether there is an appropriate photo to illustrate check-in
  - maybe the front desk?

## Tip: Write sample dialogs

<!-- <MoveFlag message="Section should be rewritten by our Content strategists?" /> -->

*(copied from Google Conversational Design guidelines)*

**Sample dialogs will give you a quick, low-fidelity sense of the “sound-and-feel” of the interaction you’re designing.** They convey the flow that the user will actually experience, without the technical distractions of code notation, complex flow diagrams, recognition-grammar issues, etc.

By writing sample dialogs, **you can informally experiment with and evaluate different design strategies**, such as how to promote the discoverability of new features or how to confirm a user’s request (for example: should you use an implicit confirmation, an explicit confirmation, or no confirmation at all?).

**The easiest way to start writing dialogs is to channel your own expertise as a lifetime communicator.** People can generally tell when something sounds right or wrong, even if they can’t articulate the underlying linguistic principles as to why it sounds that way; because of this, role-playing a dialog is the easiest way to create the initial draft and iterate on successive drafts.

|                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Step&nbsp;1** | Focus on one user persona and one key use case.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Step&nbsp;2** | Find a partner and role-play the conversation, with one person pretending they’re the user and the other pretending they’re the system persona. Record the conversation. If you don’t have a partner, you’ll have to switch between playing both roles. |
| **Step&nbsp;3** | Transcribe the conversation. **This is the first draft of your sample dialog.**                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Step&nbsp;4** | Step through the dialog, saying the user’s lines and playing each of the system persona’s lines in the text-to-speech (TTS) in which it will be rendered.                                                                                               |
| **Step&nbsp;5** | Repeat steps 1-4 with different user personas and key use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Here is an example of how our sample skill might be represented as a sample dialog:

<Notification headerText="Example: Sample dialog" textColor="#333399" borderColor="#339" icon="example" backgroundColor="#eeeeff">

| Speaker  | Customer Utterance or VA Response                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer | "How early can I check into my hotel?"                                  |
| VA       | "I see you have these bookings. Which one can I help you with?"         |
| Customer | "The hotel in San Diego"                                                |
| VA       | "Here is what your hotel says about check-in: Check-in time is 4:00 pm" |
| VA       | "Is there anything else I can help you with?"                           |

Here's a list of "Dos" to keep in mind when writing sample dialogs: from <ExternalLink linkName="Sample Dialogs: The Key to Creating Great Actions on Google" linkURL="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/09/sample-dialogs-key-to-creating-great.html" />

- Start your design by using written/spoken sample dialogs; diagrams of the detailed flow can come later
- Read your sample dialogs out loud!
- Make each sample dialog one path; they should not include branching
- Write several "happy path" sample dialogs
- Write several "error path" sample dialogs
- Do a "table read" and have people unfamiliar with your sample dialog play the part of the user
- Share your sample dialogs with everyone involved in building the Action, so everyone's on the same page
- When testing, compare the actual working Action with the sample dialogs, to ensure it was implemented - correctly
- Iterate, iterate, iterate!
