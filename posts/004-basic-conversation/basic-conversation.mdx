Conversation design is a powerful approach, but it's not right for every Action. For example, dialog works well for the task of finding a restaurant's business hours, but it feels clunky for browsing a dinner menu. Before you decide to use conversation design, evaluate whether it will supercharge your Action, making it more intuitive and efficient for users.

### Conversation design checklist

Check off as many of the statements on the left as you can to determine how good a fit your task is for conversation design.

| Questions about your project | Conversation design principle |
| --- | --- |
| <CheckListItem itemLabel="Users already have human-to-human conversations about this task or topic" /><CheckListItem itemLabel="The interaction is brief with minimal back and forth dialog" /> | **Conversation is intuitive.** It lets users say what they want to get what they want. |
|<CheckListItem itemLabel="Users would have to tap multiple times to complete the task with a screen" /><CheckListItem itemLabel="Users have to navigate multiple apps or widgets to complete the task with a screen" /><CheckListItem itemLabel="The feature would be difficult or cumbersome to find with a screen." /> | **Conversation saves the user more time and effort than a screen-based UI** Conversation can be the ultimate shortcut. It reduces friction by quickly getting the user what they want. |
| <CheckListItem itemLabel="Users can do this task while multi-tasking." /><CheckListItem itemLabel="Users can do this task while their hands or eyes are busy." /> | **Conversation lets users multi-task.** It helps them when they are busy, especially in situations where their hands or eyes are occupied, or when they're on the move. |
| <CheckListItem itemLabel="Users feel comfortable talking or typing about this subject." /> | **Conversations let users speak feely** Spoken conversations are best in private spaces or familiar shared spaces. Written conversations are best for personal devices. |

### Avoiding conversation design pitfalls

(copied from Google Conversational Design guidelines)

- Because users are cooperative, **they often offer more information than is literally required of them.** 
- Your persona won’t always be able to handle cooperative responses. In these cases, **rely on lightweight and conversational error handling to get the dialog back on track** in a way that doesn’t draw attention to the error.
- Like your users, your persona should also be cooperative and informative, **offering as much information as is necessary to advance the conversation.**
- In conversation, **saying too much is as uncooperative as saying too little.** Facilitate comprehension by keeping turns brief and optimally relevant from the user’s point of view.
