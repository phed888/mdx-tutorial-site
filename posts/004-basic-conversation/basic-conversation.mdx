Conversation design is a powerful approach, but it's not right for every Action. For example, dialog works well for the task of finding a restaurant's business hours, but it feels clunky for browsing a dinner menu. Before you decide to use conversation design, evaluate whether it will supercharge your Action, making it more intuitive and efficient for users.

  <CheckListItem itemLabel="Users can do this task while their hands or eyes are busy." isChecked="true" />

  **On the whole, our project seems like a good fit for conversation design.**

### Avoiding conversation design pitfalls

<!-- <MoveFlag message="Should be rewritten for the VA" /> -->

(copied from Google Conversational Design guidelines)

- Because users are cooperative, **they often offer more information than is literally required of them.** 
  - For instance: a customer might try to speed up the process of finding their itinerary by providing multiple pieces of information. 
- Your persona won’t always be able to handle cooperative responses. In these cases, **rely on lightweight and conversational error handling to get the dialog back on track** in a way that doesn’t draw attention to the error.
  - In the example above: The VA should be able to identify the information it needs and disregard the rest.
- Like your users, your persona should also be cooperative and informative, **offering as much information as is necessary to advance the conversation.**
  - If the VA can't meet the customer's immediate request, it should offer options that are options that are contextually useful.
- In conversation, **saying too much is as uncooperative as saying too little.** Facilitate comprehension by keeping turns brief and optimally relevant from the user’s point of view.
