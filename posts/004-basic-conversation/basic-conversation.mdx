Conversation design is a powerful approach, but it's not right for every Action. For example, dialog works well for the task of finding a restaurant's business hours, but it feels clunky for browsing a dinner menu. Before you decide to use conversation design, evaluate whether it will supercharge your Action, making it more intuitive and efficient for users.

### Conversation design checklist

**Conversation is intuitive.**
It lets users say what they want to get what they want.

- Do users already have human-to-human conversations about this task or topic?
- Is the interaction brief with minimal back and forth dialog?

**Conversation saves the user more time and effort than a screen-based UI**
Conversation can be the ultimate shortcut. It reduces friction by quickly getting the user what they want.

- Would users have to tap multiple times to complete the task with a screen?
- Would users have to navigate multiple apps or widgets to complete the task with a screen?
- Would the feature be difficult or cumbersome to find?

**Conversation lets users multitask**
It helps them when they're busy, especially in situations where their hands or eyes are occupied, or when they're on the move.

- Can users do this task while multi-tasking?
- Can users do this task when their hands or eyes are busy?

**Conversation lets users speak freely**
Spoken conversations are best in private spaces or familiar shared spaces. Written conversations are best for personal devices.

- Do users feel comfortable talking or typing about this subject?

### Avoiding conversation design pitfalls

(copied from Google Conversational Design guidelines)

- Because users are cooperative, **they often offer more information than is literally required of them.** 
- Your persona won’t always be able to handle cooperative responses. In these cases, **rely on lightweight and conversational error handling to get the dialog back on track** in a way that doesn’t draw attention to the error.
- Like your users, your persona should also be cooperative and informative, **offering as much information as is necessary to advance the conversation.**
- In conversation, **saying too much is as uncooperative as saying too little.** Facilitate comprehension by keeping turns brief and optimally relevant from the user’s point of view.
