While the flow diagram can demonstrate the logic of your solution, its important to see how the conversation will appear to the customer.

- How does it feel to interact with your conversation design?
- Do the VA responses fit on a single screen or will the customer need to scroll?
- Does the number of buttons overwhelm the customer?
- Do they stack so that they can all be seen at once?

</Notification>

- Refer to (and even use!) the <ExternalLink linkName="CDS Starter Figma file" linkURL="/" needed="true" />
- Add <ExternalLink linkName="VAC Components" linkURL="https://www.figma.com/file/vjBUZSellUT1M5eZnfp087/VAC-Components?node-id=463%3A8833" /> as an Asset to your existing Figma file.
- **Review Best practice for building out a skill**:
  - It is most efficient to create a **transcript** of the scenario that you want to illustrate. 
  - Create a **vertical auto-layout frame** for each scenario that will be documented
    - Add in every message bubble, card and quick reply that would play a part in your conversation.
  - Place each transcript inside of a frame (with â€˜Clip Content' checked) that is sized to the conversation area of the VAC window. 
  - The transcript component can slide up to progressively reveal more and more of the conversation. 
  - **Note: you can have ephemeral elements like cards and quick replies in the transcript and hide them once they've played their part in the conversation - with auto-layout, the parts of the conversation below will slide up as if the hidden elements were not there.**
  - For a basic conversation, you will need:
    - <ExternalLink linkName="Message bubbles" linkURL="http://figma.com/file/vjBUZSellUT1M5eZnfp087/VAC-Components?node-id=5826:0" /> for incoming and outgoing messages
    - <ExternalLink linkName="Quick reply buttons" linkURL="http://figma.com/file/vjBUZSellUT1M5eZnfp087/VAC-Components?node-id=6184:90738" /> 
  - In the advanced conversation tutorial, we will discuss:
    - <ExternalLink linkName="WebViews" linkURL="/" needed="true" />
    - <ExternalLink linkName="Declarative cards" linkURL="/" needed="true" />
  
      - Refund status
      - Forms
      - Tabular information

<Notification headerText="Review your designs" textColor="#663333" icon="review" backgroundColor="#ffeeee">

- Review your designs with the stakeholders identified in the <ExternalLink linkName="Virtual Agent Platform Innersource Model" linkURL="https://confluence.expedia.biz/display/VAP/Virtual+Agent+Platform+Innersource+Model" /> page. 

- The links on the left side, to the individual Innersource projects will lead to project pages that identify the stakeholders and representatives of different disciplines.
