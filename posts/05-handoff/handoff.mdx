The thinking and effort that went into your project could be used by other teams. To enable and encourage reuse, add your project to the Conversation Design System documentation. 

## Add your research readouts to the Research hub

If an interaction was worth conducting a study over, it is likely that others in the company will have the same questions. Add your research to the hub and help build the body of knowledge that defines the Virtual Assistant

## Add your flow diagram to the Flows index

The skills development team will rely on the work you've done in flow design to build the skill and to ensure that the Virtual Agent responds as intended to user input. This may be the most comprehensive view of your skill and you will want to ensure it is fully documented and available to the group. 

To add your flow diagram to the Flows directory in the CDS, go to the <ExternalLink linkName="How to create flows" linkURL="https://confluence.expedia.biz/display/GCOUX/How+to+Create+Flows" /> and read the instructions there.

## Document your components in the UDS

For a conversational flow, you will likely not need this step but if you have worked with declarative cards and have developed components that are not part of the UDS, it could serve the whole company to add your new component and make it available to everyone.

Follow the guidlines laid our in the <ExternalLink linkName="UDS Component Contruction Guide" linkURL="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/UDS-Component-Construction-Guide--A5DU0DbmfInvxoQIDZXmre3HAg-Rl71XUcT2DIsOw5nqXIIO" />

## Link your designs to the Jira ticket

## Add your research to the CDS research hub
